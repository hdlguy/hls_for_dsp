# hls_for_dsp
The goal here is to create a simple example of a HLS design that can be used as a starting point going forward.

## Introduction
Xilinx HLS can be thought of as a generalized core generator.  It will add standard AXI-4 or AXI-Streaming interfaces to the design so that it can be instantiated much like Xilinx IP Integrator cores.

## Goals
I'm not sure how to version control a HLS project so I hope to solve that problem. Also I will try to automate builds as much as possible with Gnu Make or just TCL.

Thanks for looking.
