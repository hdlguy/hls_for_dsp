# hls_for_dsp
The goal here is to create a simple example of a HLS design that can be used as a starting point going forward.

## Introduction
Xilinx HLS can be thought of as a generalized core generator.  It will add standard AXI-4 or AXI-Streaming interfaces to the design so that it can be instantiated much like Xilinx IP Integrator cores.

## Goals
1. Create an example of how to version control a HLS project.
1. Determine how to automate HLS build flows.

## Conclusion
Thanks for looking.
